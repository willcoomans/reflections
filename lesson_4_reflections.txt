When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you want to transfer your local work to github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to always pull changes manually because you can update a local repository through the use of a remote whenever you would like to. This is a better alternative because if you let Git do it automatically, then it may update your repository through a remote when you don't want it to. For example, the public repository on GitHub may contain some invalid code.
