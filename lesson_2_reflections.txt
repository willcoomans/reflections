What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you create a file where you can store other smaller files. You need a repository so you can commit at one time and save every file at once.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files can be placed one by one and then placed into the repository instead of making one commit all at once.
